### Playing with Numbers using Python has unlimited possibilities and a few of them have been put up here :
1. Printing Prime Numbers in the specified Range
2. Determining wether the number that the User has entered is a Prime Number or Not
3. Generating Random Numbers between Specified Range
4. Printing Fibonacci Sequence 
5. Finding Factorial of a Number
6. Determining wether the number that the User has entered is an Armstrong Number or Not
7. Performing Prime Factorization of a Number
8. Finding HCF/GCD of Multiple Numbers
9. Finding Roots of a Quadratic Equation (Displays Non-Real Roots as Well)
10. Finding LCM of Multiple Numbers
11. Identifying whether the year entered by the user is a Leap Year or not.
12. Finding the Largest and the Smallest Number from all the numbers provided by the user (Without using any pre-built Modules) 
13. Determining wether the number that the User has entered is a Disarium Number or Not
14. Printing Disarium Numbers in the specified Range
15. Multiplication of Matrices (Without using any pre-built Modules)
16. Finding all possible numbers that can be formed with the digits of a provided number 
17. Finding Compund Interest for the given values of Principal, Rate of Interest and Time (in years)

### Definately More to come :)
